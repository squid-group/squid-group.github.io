The Statistical Quantification of Individual Differences (SQuID) research network is offering student fellowships to collaborate with <a href="/members/" target="_blank">SQuID members</a> on new or ongoing research. <!--more--> SQuID is an international group of evolutionary and behavioral ecologists focused on the use and development of statistical tools for understanding patterns of phenotypic variability. One particular emphasis of the network is the improvement of methods to understand and draw inferences about individual variation. The SQuID Fellowships are intended to share the same goal and extend the use of advanced statistical approaches in evolutionary ecology. The Fellowships are also intended to foster new international collaborations.

Relevant projects could include: extending analyses of existing data sets, simulation studies of the performance of statistical methods, conducting meta-analyses advancing our understanding of individual variation, integrating theory and analytical approaches, and many others. Fellowships are available to graduate students and post-doctoral researchers.

Applications will be primarily evaluated on the degree to which the proposed work advances our ability to understand the contributions to, and structure of, individual variation.

Fellowships will cover travel and lodging costs of applicants to a host lab, with a target budget of 6000 USD.

Applications will be reviewed on a rolling basis with three target deadlines per year. For 2022 and 2023, target deadlines are: 
- 1 December 2022, 
- 1 April 2023, 
- 1 August 2023, 
- and 1 December 2023.

Applications should include (as a single PDF file):

- A cover letter (1-2 pages) briefly describing the research question (detailed description can be restricted to a separate research statement), the relevance of the research to the goals of the SQuID network, prior statistical experience and training, and the justification of host lab choice. The cover letter should also state whether the applicant has previously attended a SQuID workshop.
- A concise research statement—up to 3 pages, not including references—that articulates the research question(s), methods to be used or developed, necessary resources for the project, scope of collaboration with SQuID member(s), and expected outcomes.
- A CV 
- A budget describing travel and lodging costs (<a href="/assets/documents/Fellowship_Budget_Form.pdf" target="_blank">link to fillable PDF</a>)
- A letter of support from the applicant’s current supervisor (<a href="/assets/documents/Fellowship_Adviser_Support.pdf" target="_blank">link to fillable PDF</a>)
- A letter of support from the hosting SQuID member (<a href="/assets/documents/Host_Letter.pdf" target="_blank">link to fillable PDF</a>)
